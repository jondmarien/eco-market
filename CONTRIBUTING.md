## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Docker (for local development)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecomarket.git
   cd ecomarket
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   > Run `npm install` after cloning the repository. After that, every `git commit` will automatically execute the configured pre-commit hooks to check your changes.

#### Windows Users - One-Line Setup

For Windows contributors, we provide a convenient PowerShell script that handles the complete development environment setup:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-dev-tools.ps1
```

This script will:
- Install Node.js dependencies
- Create a Python virtual environment and install development requirements
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Install Go development tools (golangci-lint)

**Note:** Ensure you have Node.js, Python, and Go installed on your system before running this script.

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with the following prefixes:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions/updates

Example: `feature/user-authentication`

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commit format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting changes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat(user-service): add email verification`

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Fill out the pull request template
5. Request review from appropriate code owners
6. Address feedback and re-request review
7. Once approved, the PR will be merged by a maintainer

### PR Requirements

- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG is updated (for significant changes)

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for new code
- Follow Prettier configuration
- Use ESLint rules
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Database

- Follow database naming conventions
- Include migrations for schema changes
- Document complex queries

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Include proper error handling
- Implement rate limiting

## Testing

### Test Structure

```
/services/user-service/

    â”œâ”€â”€ unit/
    â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
    â””â”€â”€ e2e/
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests for specific service
