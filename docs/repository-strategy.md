# Repository Strategy for EcoMarket

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the repository strategy decision for the EcoMarket project, comparing mono-repository and multi-repository approaches, and explaining our chosen approach.

## Decision: Mono-Repository with Nx/Turbo

**Selected Approach**: Mono-repository using Nx or Turbo for workspace management

## Comparison Analysis

### Mono-Repository Approach

#### Pros ✅

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - All code lives in one repository
   - Easier to maintain consistency across services
   - Simplified dependency management

2. **Atomic Changes**
   - Can make changes across multiple services in a single commit
   - Ensures compatibility between services during refactoring
   - Easier rollbacks

3. **Shared Tooling & Configuration**
   - Common linting, testing, and build configurations
   - Shared CI/CD pipelines
   - Consistent code standards

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Single clone operation
   - Easier onboarding for new developers
   - Better code discovery and reuse

5. **Simplified Operations**
   - One repository to monitor
   - Easier branch management
   - Unified issue tracking

#### Cons ❌

1. **Scale Challenges**
   - Repository size grows with all services
   - Potentially slower CI/CD as project grows
   - All developers have access to entire codebase

2. **Coupling Risk**
   - Risk of creating tight coupling between services
   - Shared dependencies can create conflicts
   - Harder to enforce service boundaries

3. **Team Autonomy**
   - Less team independence
   - Shared release cycles
   - Potential merge conflicts

### Multi-Repository Approach

#### Pros ✅

1. **Service Independence**
   - Clear service boundaries
   - Independent deployment cycles
   - Team autonomy and ownership

2. **Technology Flexibility**
   - Different tech stacks per service
   - Independent dependency management
   - Service-specific tooling

3. **Access Control**
   - Fine-grained permissions
   - Reduced security blast radius
   - Team-specific repositories

4. **Scalability**
   - Smaller, focused repositories
   - Faster CI/CD per service
   - Independent scaling

#### Cons ❌

1. **Operational Complexity**
   - Multiple repositories to manage
   - Complex dependency tracking
   - Difficult cross-service changes

2. **Code Duplication**
   - Shared code must be extracted to libraries
   - Potential for duplicated utilities
   - Version management complexity

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Multiple clones required
   - Complex local development setup
   - Harder code discovery

4. **Consistency Challenges**
   - Different tooling configurations
   - Varying code standards
   - Multiple CI/CD pipelines

## Recommendation: Mono-Repository

### Why Mono-Repository for EcoMarket?

1. **Early Stage Advantage**
   - EcoMarket is in early development
   - Team size is manageable
   - Services are still evolving

2. **Microservices Coordination**
   - E-commerce services are highly interconnected
   - Frequent cross-service changes expected
   - Shared domain models and types

3. **Team Structure**
   - Small to medium team size
   - Full-stack developers working across services
   - Need for rapid iteration

4. **Technical Benefits**
   - Simplified local development
   - Easier integration testing
   - Shared libraries and utilities

### Implementation Strategy

#### Tooling Selection

**Option 1: Nx (Recommended)**
- Mature mono-repo tooling
- Excellent TypeScript/JavaScript support
- Smart rebuild capabilities
- Rich plugin ecosystem

**Option 2: Turbo**
- Fast build system
- Good caching capabilities
- Simpler configuration
- Growing ecosystem

#### Workspace Structure

```
ecomarket/
├── services/
│   ├── user-service/
│   ├── product-catalog-service/
│   └── order-service/
├── frontend/
│   └── customer-web/
├── shared/
│   ├── types/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── components/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── docker/
│   ├── k8s/
│   └── gateway/
├── tools/
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── configs/
└── docs/
```

#### Migration Path

If we need to split later:
1. Each service is already well-organized
2. Shared code is in `/shared` directory
3. Clear service boundaries are maintained
4. Can extract services to separate repos incrementally

### Governance & Best Practices

#### Code Organization
- Clear service boundaries
- Shared code in dedicated packages
- No direct cross-service imports
- Service-to-service communication via APIs

#### Development Workflow
- Feature branches for changes
- PR reviews with appropriate code owners
- Automated testing and quality gates
- Continuous integration

#### Tooling Standards
- Consistent linting and formatting
- Shared TypeScript configuration
- Common testing frameworks
- Unified build processes

### Success Metrics

- Developer onboarding time
- Build and test execution time
- Cross-service change frequency
- Code reuse percentage
- CI/CD pipeline efficiency

### Future Considerations

#### When to Consider Multi-Repository

1. **Team Size**: When teams grow beyond 50+ developers
2. **Service Maturity**: When services become stable with clear APIs
3. **Technology Divergence**: When services need different tech stacks
4. **Compliance**: When different security/compliance requirements emerge
5. **Performance**: When mono-repo becomes too slow

#### Exit Strategy

If migration becomes necessary:
1. Extract shared libraries to separate repositories
2. Move services incrementally
3. Maintain shared CI/CD patterns
4. Update documentation and workflows

## Conclusion

The mono-repository approach with Nx/Turbo provides the best balance of developer productivity, operational simplicity, and technical flexibility for EcoMarket's current stage and requirements. This decision can be revisited as the project and team scales.
